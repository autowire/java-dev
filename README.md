# java-dev

Just a small virtual box setup containing an Ubuntu 16.04 installation with Java
and Eclipse pre-installed.

I'll only use this machine for some exercises at HSLU. With that I do not have to install Java
on my machine. Yeay! :tada:

## Setup

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up --provision
vagrant ssh
```

Login with username *batman* and password *bruce*.
